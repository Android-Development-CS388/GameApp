## Overview
### Description
An app that displays information about different games, and other relevant information about gaming topics. If users are interested in a particular game, the app will direct them to the Steam page to purchase or look at the game. The app can be used to look at different games and relevant news in the industry. 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Gaming / News
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as Steam. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Using different APIs, the app will be a place to consolidate news, game information, and other topics. Users can also be directed to other places to get more information or to purchase games.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would be organized into age groups to restrict them based off of rating or country.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on what games they are interested in, and what exactly theyâ€™re looking for.
- **Scope:** First, we can start by listing the top 20 most popular games and all their relevant information, then broaden the usage to include all games that are listed, and search for different games.
